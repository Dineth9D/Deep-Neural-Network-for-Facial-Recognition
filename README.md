# **Deep Neural Network for Facial Recognition**

A deep Neural Network has been built for facial recognition applications to authenticate users into an application. The model was developed using Deep Learning with TensorFlow specifically for One-shot Image Recognition. With a total of 38 million parameters, the model was optimized using Adam optimization, a popular optimization algorithm for Neural Networks. The model has achieved an impressive accuracy score of 98.8%, making it highly reliable for authentication purposes. This Neural Network is a powerful tool for businesses and organizations looking to enhance their security measures and improve their user authentication processes.
